What is Clone X NFT by Takashi Murakami? While there are many NFT projects headed to the metaverse, none of them holds a candle to the iterations developed in the Clone X -Takeshi project. It is spearheading toward the metaverse with high-end NFT avatars that are designed within a 3d ecosystem. Clone X NFT Clone X NFT is short for Clone X by Takashi Murakami. This mouthful of an NFT project is a collection of 20,000 next-generation avatars created as a collaboration between Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami and design studio RTFKT. All characters are designed to be metaverse ready. Each NFT is a collection of 11 traits, ranging from accessories to back to DNA to eye colour and more. The Clone X has been described as one of the ambitious NFT projects by RTKFT and Takashi Murakami. The devs have described it as a project that focuses on the whole ecosystem to drive the community towards and into the metaverse with the help of NFTs that focus on quality. According to the backstory of this Clone X: Clone X Corp came to life when three extra-terrestrials from Orbitar in the Draco constellation came to earn and started focusing on creating technology that can evolve them towards an immaterial existence. They desire to transfer human consciousness to advanced clone forms to create the ultimate metaverse. There is no human limited by the limitations of their biology in this metaverse. Every human is represented by their digital Clone &ndash; X avatars. &nbsp; The lore further goes into how these avatars are the artistic expressions of those humans &ndash; allowing them to move past their limitations and across new galaxies and simulations. The aim behind the creation of this project was to pave the way for virtual wearables and was introduced at a time when PFP (Profile Pictures) NFT projects were the most common. But it took the market by storm during launch, garnering much attention from NFT-bros who were looking for a project that is more than just a big roadmap. And right off the bat, Clone X grabbed their attention with its 3D artwork with anime undertones. The project was first introduced as a presale, with the maker saying they &ldquo;want to make this project as affordable as possible&rdquo;. In this presale, 11,133 NFTs were given away at just 0.5ETH. That price point was a great buying opportunity for the early movers because once the project landed on Opensea, its prices grew to 4.9ETH in December 2021. Clone X Takashi trended sideways for a while but then increased parabolically to 15.49ETH by the end of January. It was during the heyday of NFTs, and Clone X Takashi Went through another uptick to its all-time high of 19.2ETH soon after. The NFT&rsquo;s value then retreated in response to the bear market when NFT sales hit an all-time low. However, because of the strength behind this project and the bullishness of NFT enthusiasts, Clone-X could find support around the 5.5ETH price point. Clone X Takashi has become one of the more interesting NFT projects as of late since it has been hit the least by the bear market. Even BAYC has dropped around 1ETH levels. Developers are still bullish about this project and are continually working to make it more relevant for the newer, use case-seeking NFT crowd.
